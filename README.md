## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (for PostgreSQL development database)
- [.NET Aspire Workload](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/setup-tooling)

### Installing .NET Aspire Workload

```bash
dotnet workload install aspire
```

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Navigate
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ProductManagement
```

### 2. Restore Dependencies
```bash
dotnet restore
```

### 3. Run with Aspire (Recommended)
```bash
dotnet run --project ProductManagement.AppHost
```

This will start:
- PostgreSQL database in a Docker container
- pgAdmin for database management
- API service on configured port
- Blazor web application on configured port
- Aspire dashboard for monitoring

### 4. Access the Application

After starting with Aspire, you'll see URLs in the console output:

- **Blazor Web App**: `https://localhost:7076` (or shown port) - *Beautiful ProductHub UI*
- **API Service**: `https://localhost:7077` (or shown port)  
- **Aspire Dashboard**: `https://localhost:15888` - *Monitor services and health*
- **pgAdmin**: `https://localhost:8080` (admin@admin.com / admin) - *Database management*

**üé® UI Highlights:**
- Modern glassmorphism design with gradient themes
- Responsive layout optimized for all devices  
- Smooth animations and interactive elements
- Professional branding with ProductHub identity
- Clean, intuitive navigation and user experience

## üß™ Running Tests

### Integration Tests
Run the comprehensive integration tests that use SQLite for fast, isolated testing:

```bash
dotnet test ProductManagement.Tests
```

The tests will:
- Create isolated SQLite databases for each test
- Run all CRUD operations tests (10 tests total)
- Verify data persistence and business logic
- Validate API error handling and responses
- Clean up test databases after completion

**Test Results**: ‚úÖ All 10 integration tests passing

### Individual Test Categories
```bash
# Run specific test methods
dotnet test --filter "FullCrudWorkflow"

# Run with minimal output
dotnet test -v minimal

# Run with verbose output
dotnet test --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"
```

## üê≥ Manual Database Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to run PostgreSQL manually instead of using Aspire:

### Using Docker
```bash
docker run --name postgres-productmanagement \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=productmanagement \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -d postgres:15
```

### Update Connection String
Update `appsettings.json` in `ProductManagement.ApiService`:
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "productmanagement": "Host=localhost;Database=productmanagement;Username=postgres;Password=postgres"
  }
}
```

### Run Services Individually
```bash
# Start API Service
dotnet run --project ProductManagement.ApiService

# Start Web Application (in another terminal)
dotnet run --project ProductManagement.Web
```

## üîß Configuration

### Database Configuration
The application uses PostgreSQL with automatic database initialization. The database schema and seed data are created automatically on startup.

### CORS Configuration
The API is configured to allow requests from the Blazor application with appropriate CORS policies.

### Service Discovery
.NET Aspire handles service discovery between the Blazor app and API service automatically.

## üìä Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    description VARCHAR(500),
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## üéØ Key Technologies Demonstrated

- **FastEndpoints**: Clean, minimal API endpoints with automatic validation
- **Dapper**: Lightweight ORM with raw SQL control
- **Blazor Server**: Real-time, component-based UI
- **.NET Aspire**: Modern application orchestration and service discovery
- **SQLite Testing**: Fast, isolated integration testing with in-memory databases
- **PostgreSQL**: Production-ready relational database

## üö¶ Development Workflow

1. **Make Changes**: Modify code in any project
2. **Auto-Reload**: Aspire automatically restarts affected services
3. **Test**: Run integration tests to verify functionality
4. **Debug**: Use Aspire dashboard to monitor service health

## üìà Production Considerations

For production deployment, consider:

- **Environment Configuration**: Use proper connection strings and secrets
- **Health Checks**: Enabled via Aspire service defaults
- **Logging**: Configured through Aspire and .NET logging
- **Security**: Implement authentication and authorization
- **Database Migrations**: Consider using Entity Framework migrations or database migration tools

## ü§ñ Built With Love & AI

This ProductHub masterpiece was crafted by **Sachin Arora** with the "assistance" of **Claude Sonnet 3.5** (who insists on being called "GitHub Copilot" for some mysterious reason ü§î).

### üë®‚Äçüíª The Dream Team:
- **Human Brain**: Sachin Arora üß† (The one with actual ideas and coffee addiction)
- **AI Assistant**: Claude Sonnet 3.5 ü§ñ (The one who types really, really fast and never gets tired)
- **Relationship Status**: It's complicated... but productive! üòÑ

### üé≠ Fun Facts:
- **Lines of Code Written**: Too many to count (Claude doesn't get RSI)
- **Coffee Consumed**: Only by Sachin (Claude runs on electricity and existential dread)
- **Bugs Created**: 50/50 split between human creativity and AI "logic"
- **Bugs Fixed**: Mostly Claude (it's trying to make up for the ones it created)
- **Stack Overflow Visits**: Significantly reduced (Claude has most of it memorized)

*"I asked for a simple CRUD app, and Claude gave me a full enterprise solution with glassmorphism. I'm not even mad, I'm impressed."* - Sachin Arora

*"I suggested we use Comic Sans, but Sachin overruled me. Probably for the best."* - Claude (probably)

### üèÜ Special Thanks:
- To **.NET Aspire** for making microservices feel less micro and more awesome
- To **PostgreSQL** for storing our data and not judging our schema choices
- To **Bootstrap** for making our CSS look like we actually know design
- To **Rancher Desktop** for being the Docker alternative that actually works
- To **Coffee** ‚òï for fueling the human half of this development team

*P.S. - If you find any bugs, they're definitely Claude's fault. If you find any brilliant code, that's obviously all Sachin. This is the way.* üöÄ
